    "- Developed for Linux project requirments\n",

    "    2. Staging area: pre-commit holding area\n",
    "        - Queuing up area for next commit\n",
    "        - For files here are not committed yet, you can move them in and out.\n",
    "    3. Commit: Git Repository (history)\n",
    "        - Normally, there is a hidden folder called .git folder with in the working directory, that contains the actual git repository. It manages the commits\n",
